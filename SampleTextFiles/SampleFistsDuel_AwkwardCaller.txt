[16:20:03] DUEL Awkward: <B>"Anytime!" Thumbs up for Baeldyn and JC. "I'm sorry, I didn't get your name?" Waving over to The Breaker as she scribbles something down in her lap. </B>
[16:20:19] The Game: She smiled brightly and clapped for JC's victory as she spat out the stick.
[16:21:25] The Breaker: He smiled back at Grace. "Jin 'The Breaker' Sin."
[16:21:26] Baeldyn332: Out of the ring,into the back room.
[16:21:37] JC: Stepping out of the ring, she gave Dani a wary look before heading that direction. "Hi Morgan-spawn-carrier." She didn't say it meanly, it was just kind of a title like 'Noona' or 'Best Chae'.
[16:21:58] Sandalio del Saenz: Sandy still just pouted. One leg was crossed over the other at his knee and the leather creaked in protest as he bobbed that foot up and down. "The Breaker," he muttered. "You don't like anybody, Hope."
[16:22:57] DUEL Awkward: <B>Pita 1: Ooooo Jin the Breaker, is breaking right through Izumi's fancy moves there and she can't avoid that spinkick. (Spk/FADO, 1 Jin)</B>
[16:23:05] The Game: She noted that look but didn't say anything.  The nickname had her smile and even a bit of a giggle, "Hi there Jenny.  How have you been?"
[16:24:16] DUEL Awkward: <B>"We have Les looking for magic. Any takers?" Curious as she waved to the new faces. Or --well actually just all the faces. </B>
[16:24:25] The Queen: "Sure I do! I like Fearless Leader and Shadow and you and Zack and Peaches and Kruger is a great guy and D..." Well, she liked who she liked, with a little cough coming up and a little nervous fidgeting before she finished the drink and turned around. Some things like a red face weren't too high on her list to show.
[16:24:45] Davien: Darkened skin swelled beneath lackluster eyes, an indication of the misery he had endured throughout the night after he had slipped from her bed, unable to find the sleep that surely would have given him a short reprieve. Hands moved roughshod through haphazard dark locks in an attempt to appear kempt and less desolate than he felt. A smile forced to the surface, purely for the benefit of Hope and those she entertained.
[16:24:49] = Roulette has entered the room =
[16:25:42] The Cursed Leviathan: Selecting what appeared to be the best wine the place had to offer, as he pluckedd a clean glass down and started back towards his table. Setting down down on the tabletop when he reached it, waiting till he sat back down to fill the glass.
[16:25:47] The Breaker: He was misleading with his measurements as he slung his right foot arcing around, whiplashing at Izumi's braced defense. Not going to shatter any ribs today, just a little thing to push her back.
[16:26:19] Sandalio del Saenz: "Taken, taken, taken, and taken." He counted them off on his fingers. Sandy grabbed the long island iced tea before it could even leave a ring of condensation on the bar. It was tilted up and didn't come back down until it was gone.
[16:26:32] Izumi Takamine: It was pretty clear from the look on Izumi's face that hadn't been quite what she expected, but she recovered stance gamely enough after she stopped stumbling back.  Grinning as she hopped a bit.
[16:27:00] JC: "Ehh, that's a debatable thing, busy I guess. Yourself? Been taking care of you and uh..." Vague gesture toward Dani's midsection, "it?"
[16:27:56] Davien: A short bow at the waist, respect given to those gathered close to her before he chose a seat and deposited his exhausted body.
[16:28:01] The Game: A nod then, "Busy as well.  I hardly ever see Morgan anymore."  At the gesture she smiled as she rubbed her belly, "A boy.  We haven't decided on a name yet though."
[16:29:11] DUEL Awkward: <B>Pita 2: Izumi is blocking, but Jin is grabbing and sending her flying! (FL/AB, 2 Jin)</B>
[16:29:33] The Queen: She needed a little something to clear her throat out and reached for that long island glass before filling it up for her own taste, and as she turned to face the room again cleared of any tells, she spit the remaining of the mix out on Sandy's neck. Accidentally of course! She set the glass down and immediately defaulted to factory settings. She polevaulted the bar with the Banshee Shriek, unfortunately not helping Sandy clean up before she walked up and stood in front of him. She would love to
[16:29:57] The Queen: play charades today and figure out what his excuse was this time. She tapped at his foot with the base of the spear and stared at him. She had a good tough guy act, even if it really was just an act.
[16:31:09] Sandalio del Saenz: Sandy wasn't expecting the cold rush of iced alcohol on his neck and he jumped like a scalded cat when it hit. A string of Spanish curses was yelled as he hit the floor with a dull thud.
[16:32:04] The Breaker: Kkangpae style was hot today it seemed as he took her by the forearms and looked like he might throw her right out of the ring. He halted, before doing considerable damage and instead just rolled her over his back and onto the mat. "You're not traditionally trained. Self taught?"
[16:32:06] DUEL Awkward: <B>Startled from eyeing the rings, she looked up to the action with the yelling Sandy. </B>
[16:32:21] The Cursed Leviathan: Lifting the glass up to his lips as he spared a glance towards what was going on in one of the rings, only to look back towards the bar as the male from before cried out and hit the floor.
[16:33:21] Sandalio del Saenz: "What the hell?" he was not sure what to do, so he flailed a bit on the floor in the puddle of ice and alcohol. "Hope?" Because the whole banshee thing and all of that had him confused as to how to react at thsi point.
[16:33:22] DUEL Shadow: <B>After having spent some time meditating on the nature of eldritch beings and nerf guns, the elf seemed to return his attention to this place and time. And took a bottle swig of the rum.</B>
[16:33:39] Izumi Takamine: That's just what you called caught napping, turtled up in her defense.  Her judo background paid here as she was able to absorb energy of a fall and get up quickly unhurt.  "Mostly"  she replied with a nod of agreement.
[16:33:49] Davien: Confusion muddied features that had been forced into something more bright and clean for her benefit; he was unable to understand why she appeared so angry. A helpless shrug of his shoulders was the only charade she would receive as the man had very little patience or care in dealing with difficult women, even his Hope.
[16:34:20] JC: "You and me both." She snorted a bit. "Is he at least still working? Taking care of things?" A boy, that got her to perk a brow. Slow nod. "Well, don't name him Jin, there's enough of us around here." Nodding toward The Breaker in the ring. Mostly because she kept hearing the ring calls and thinking it was her own name being called. Idle conversation, really. "Well um, yeah, glad things are going...uh well?"
[16:36:08] DUEL Awkward: <B>Pita 3: His kick is just a little higher and a little faster than Izumi's smooth sweep. (SK/LS, 3 Jin)</B>
[16:36:08] The Game: "Yeah, all he does is seem to work.  I either catch him when he's asleep, waking up, or on his way to work.  He's hardly ever home.  I've taken to working from home and preparing for when the baby arrives."  They would be okay she knew they would.  She chuckled then, "We won't name him Jin."
[16:36:16] DUEL Shadow: <B>"Davien!" He waved vigorously to the man. "Lesinda!" Turning his wave toward her.</B>
[16:36:45] Lesinda: Pulling her hipflask free of her pocket, Les brought it up to her lips after removing the cap and drank deep from it;s contents for a few seconds before it was settled onto the table so she could return Shadow's waves with her own and threw in a smile for free!
[16:36:54] The Queen: She couldn't really hold onto the iron chin act and gently brushed at his shoulders, making sure they were wrinkle free before she took a seat on his left leg. She leaned in a little close to his ear and whispered a breath, still somewhat doused with the alchol. "You look great today."
[16:38:39] DUEL Shadow: <B>It was probably Shadow anyway. Sounded like him! His ears and upper face were covered in a black mask and bandana. Which might have explained earlier pirate accents.</B>
[16:38:57] The Breaker: He did have a range lead on her which he would entirely point to this round and the previous two for coming up a hair ahead of her each time. He took a short leap over her kick and delivered a back-hand palm to her shoulder just to inforce the space between them. "It's not bad. Could put that to good use in the right circles."
[16:39:44] Lesinda: Well, she could always rely on her sense of smell, couldn't she? Or just the sound of his voice!
[16:40:17] Davien: A friendly face, thanks be to the spirits! His gaze shifted from the pain in his backside, also known as Hope, to the pirate with Baron Shadow's voice. A deep bow of respect was afforded the man before his lap was suddenly less vacant. The pendulum upon which feminine moods swung baffled him more than nearly any other thing. A brow arched at her words, as he was still processing what exactly was occurring.
[16:40:41] DUEL Shadow: <B>He smelled like rum, and turkey jerky.</B>
[16:41:10] DUEL Awkward: <B>Apparently several people today keenly knew what Shadow smelled like. "Let me know if anyone else wants to get in the rings! Les is still looking for a magic match and I'm eager to call it."</B>
[16:41:19] DUEL Shadow: <B>He returned Davien's bow with an incline of his head.</B>
[16:41:27] Izumi Takamine: Spacing established, she bounced a bit to try to get into some kind of momentum or groove.  "That's just me.  Too mule headed for most formal instruction, beyond my judo from school"
[16:41:34] DUEL Shadow: <B>"Arr, put me matey Grace ta work!"</B>
[16:41:39] Lesinda: She has never had either of these things before. Suddenly feels a little curious and cautious that the odd man that sounds like Shadow knows who she is. Scarty pirate!
[16:41:39] Sandalio del Saenz: Sandy huffed and puffed and got to his feet with as much dignity as he could muster. And it wasn't much. He set out to find a few towels to clean up his mentor's mess and to dry off with. Those curses were mumbled and muttered and just kept on coming.
[16:42:34] DUEL Shadow: <B>The Shadow Knows. Things. Sometimes.</B>
[16:42:37] DUEL Awkward: <B>"Matey is friend right?" Double checking before her fingers twisted at a ring on her finger. </B>
[16:43:22] JC: "Working is better than getting into trouble." Which Morgan definitely had a knack for. A relieved nod followed. "Okay, good." Phew. A quick look around "Also, I could go for another swords match." That for anyone before looking back to Dani. "So um do you guys like uh, need anything for the baby?" Last word had almost been 'thing' but she caught herself.
[16:43:28] The Cursed Leviathan: Gaze once again shifted towards Shadow as he spoke like a pirate again while lowering the glass to the table, only to let his fingers tap against the tabletop again.
[16:43:37] DUEL Awkward: <B>Pita 4: I love punching! Don't you guys? Let's do this some more! (JB/JB, 4 - 1 Jin)</B>
[16:43:40] DUEL Shadow: <B>"Indeed, Grace, more specifically a nautical term for shipmate. But we'll let that detail slide today."</B>
[16:44:25] The Queen: She hid behind Davien's form and felt quite badly about leaving Sandy in a wet mess of her drink alchemy. She took a peak over the man's head to spy Sandy grabbing some cleaning supplies and whispered something else in his ear. This time it was a bit more of a private affair, that wasn't for the walls that listened around these parts.
[16:45:53] DUEL Awkward: <B>"Oh, okay. Thank you." Appreciating that from Shadow before a glance around the room. "Best Chae for Swords and Les for Magic, You guys have options so step right up to have some fun."</B>
[16:46:21] Lesinda: Les rubbed at her nose slightly, was watching the rings and waiting for someone to take her up on the magic duel.
[16:46:29] Izumi Takamine: The delinquent finally thought to use her hands, firing a measuring stick sort of left from her leading side aimed at his shoulder.  Too little too late, and she was caught in the exchange.
[16:46:38] Sandalio del Saenz: "I want to punch the hell out of someone!" he yelled from his cleaning up behind the bar.
[16:47:12] The Breaker: He swung a quick, short left that was really just to remind her he was willing to throw the punch. She matched his effort and left him smiling after the hit. "A good foundation is key, that judo will serve. But look at the katana, it's not the highest quality metal, not nearly. But after repeated folds, after it is continuously refined, even a dull blade can end up severing a man's head."
[16:47:29] The Game: She gave a nod then, "Yeah, that it is."  They ran into a few snags but she thought it was going to work.  There was no going back now!  A slight chuckle as she shook her head, "No, I think we will be fine.  But if you want to get us something I won't say no.  Maybe you can babysit?"  She teased.
[16:48:38] DUEL Awkward: <B>Pita 5: Izumi is getting some air, but The Breaker is living up to the name and still catches her with his Upper Cut. (UC/JK, 5-1 Jin)</B>
